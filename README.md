# CUDA-Programming-C++

This repository contains my learning of CUDA framework with C++. Later the concepts were applied to industrial semiconductor menufacturing projects. 
Notable projects in this repo:
* [SFF_CUDA_DLL](https://github.com/EmonRezaBD/CUDA-Programming/tree/main/SFF/SFF_CUDA_DLL/SFF_CUDA) : A 3D surface geometry is generated from around 04GB of RGB images. A DLL is developed to integrate it with existing MFC software since CUDA is not directly compatible with /MTd runtime-system. 
* [cudaDataAcquisition](https://github.com/EmonRezaBD/CUDA-Programming/tree/main/Basler/cudaDataAcquisition/cudaDataAcquisition) : This project accomplish directly data acquisition from machine vision camera (Basler) to NVIDIA GPU.
* Follow my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emonrezabd/) for some CUDA tutorial.
